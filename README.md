# ATVM Mumbai Local

  ATVM stands for automatic ticket vending machine
  
  It was part of an experiment given in college to create GUI, but it was too much fun to create
  The use of the image of the map of Mumbai Local trains and radio buttons, helped it to be a user friendly GUI application
  
  The backend of the application is C#, and was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
  
  Cheerios!
